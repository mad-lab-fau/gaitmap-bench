{"short_description": "Modern MaD pipeline with optimized ZUPT detection", "long_description": "A version of the modern MaD pipeline with more advanced ZUPT detection. Specfically, thismethod forces the existence of one ZUPT event per stride. This can help with fast walks, where a simple threshold based ZUPT detector tuned for normal speeds might not be able to detect ZUPT events.", "references": ["https://doi.org/10.1186/s12984-021-00883-7", "https://www.mad.tf.fau.de/person/liv-herzer-2/", "TODO: CITATION FOR RTS KALMAN"], "code_authors": ["MaD-DiGait"], "algorithm_authors": ["See source and references for individual algorithm authors"], "implementation_url": "https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap"}
