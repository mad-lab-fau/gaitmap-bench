{"short_description": "Kalman filter with RTS smoothing using the Madgwick algorithms for orientation estimation", "long_description": "Spatial parameters are estimated by a Error Tracking Kalman Filter (ETKF) with Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing. Compared to a typical implementation of such a filter, this implementation uses the Madgwick algorithm for orientation estimation instead of simply integration of the Gyroscope data. This approach is so far unpublished, but seems to work well. For ZUPT detection this method uses a simple threshold on the norm of the gyro data.", "references": ["https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6418869", "http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/4/825", "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5975346/", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02508"], "code_authors": ["MaD-DiGait"], "algorithm_authors": ["Arne K\u00fcderle (Integration of Madgwick)", "See references for other components"], "implementation_url": "https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap"}
