{"short_description": "Kalman filter with RTS smoothing", "long_description": "Spatial parameters are estimated by a Error Tracking Kalman Filter (ETKF) with Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing.  For ZUPT detection this method uses a more advanced ZUPT detector that forces the existence of one ZUPT event per stride. This can help with fast walks, where a simple threshold based ZUPT detector tuned for normal speeds might not be able to detect ZUPT events.", "references": ["https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6418869", "http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/4/825", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02508"], "code_authors": ["MaD-DiGait"], "algorithm_authors": ["See references"], "implementation_url": "https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap"}
