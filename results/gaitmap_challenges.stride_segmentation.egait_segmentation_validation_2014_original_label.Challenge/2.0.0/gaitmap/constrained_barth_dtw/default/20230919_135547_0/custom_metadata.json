{"short_description": "DTW based stride segmentation algorithm from Barth et al. (2014) with additional constraints", "long_description": "This algorithms finds strides by matching them with a predefined template using DTW. Compared to the normal DTW algorithm, this version set an lower and an upper limit for the stride duration that  can be matched. This entry uses the default parameters from the gaitmap library that are not specifically tuned for any dataset. Further, it uses the default template from the original publication.
