{"short_description": "DTW based stride segmentation algorithm from Barth et al. (2014) with additional constraints and optimized hyper parameters", "long_description": "This algorithms finds strides by matching them with a predefined template using DTW. Compared to the normal DTW algorithm, this version set an lower and an upper limit for the stride duration that  can be matched. This entry optimizes the `max_cost` and the `max_template_stretch` hyper parameters and the sensor axis used for matching using a TPE optimizer. However, the template is still the default template from the original publication.
